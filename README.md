# Bootstrap-WTP-Television-Analysis

Project Overview  
This project is focused on applying Bootstrap Regression techniques to derive confidence intervals for willingness to pay (WTP) evaluations on non-price attributes of products. The analysis employs both residual and data bootstrap methods to ensure robustness and accuracy in the confidence interval estimates.

Features  
Bootstrap Methods: Implements both residual and data bootstrap techniques to generate resampled datasets and estimates.  
Confidence Interval Calculation: Calculates 95% confidence intervals for each team member's WTP for various non-price attributes, enhancing the reliability of our estimations.  
R Code Implementation: The methodology is implemented in R, incorporating functions to automate the bootstrap process and confidence interval computations.  
Detailed Results Presentation: Outputs include a detailed table for each team member, listing WTP estimates alongside their lower and upper confidence bounds, separately for both bootstrap methods.  
Understanding Bootstrap Techniques: Provides a concise explanation of the residual and data bootstrap methods, helping clarify the approach used for the analysis.  

Purpose  
The primary goal of this project is to deepen the understanding of bootstrap methods in regression analysis, particularly in estimating the confidence intervals for WTP. This knowledge is crucial for making informed decisions in product design and marketing strategies based on consumer preference data.
